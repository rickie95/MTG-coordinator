+ **Project Title**: A peer-to-peer BT based matchup app.
+ **Student**: Riccardo Malavolti
+ **CFUs**: 6

Card games such as Magic the Gathering has a strong and passionate comunity, which is very active in the form of tournaments and parties. Official and sanctioned events are organized by shops and regional comunities, using software provided by Wizards of The Coast (the company owner of MtG). For non-official/private events - hosted in a shop or in a private location - there are some free tools: AetherHub provides a browser-based organizer, but as many other services, lacks of interactivity.

The main concept in this project, is to create interactivity and give immediate feedback during the tournament: the tournament's host creates the event on the app and players can be join with a simple tap. At every turn automatic matchups will be created, following the commons criteria (odd player's number, w/l ratio, ecc) until showing the leaderboard at the very end of the tournament.

During the match, the app will show the player's and his opponent lifepoints. When one of them will reach 0, the app will notify the ending of the match on both devices and send a notification to the tournament's host. 

# Tools and Techniques

The app rely on the use of Bluetooth tecnology, in order to provide a serverless service.
+ **Flutter** is the candidate framework for build an app capable of use Bluetooth.
